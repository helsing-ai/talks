## Materials

We believe in the power of knowledge sharing and continuous learning. This
repository was created to provide a central location for talks and presentations
Helsing has delivered. Whether you missed a talk or want to revisit the
content, you'll find the materials here.

The repository is organised as follows:

- [2025] `zero-to-macros/slides.md`: Slides from the *0 -> Macros (feat. Rust)* talk at [IC Hack 2025](https://ichack.org/)
- [2024] `ai-done-quick/slides.pdf`: Slides from the *AI Done Quick* talk at [AI for Ukraine Recovery Hackathon 2024](https://blog.helsing.ai/ai-for-ukraine-recovery-hackathon-eac351a3afad)
